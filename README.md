# ShinyCesium

simple shiny test application to run Cesium from Shiny. 

[Cesium](http://cesiumjs.org/index.html) is an open-source JavaScript library for world-class 3D globes and maps. It offers an alternative to the, now deprecated, Google Earth JavaScript API.   

The Shiny application implements a [hello world example](http://cesiumjs.org/tutorials/cesium-up-and-running/#hello-again-world) from the the Cesium website.

The www container also contains a stand alone index.html file, which must be run from a server in order to work.
